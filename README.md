# Wisecow Application Deployment

This project demonstrates the deployment of the Wisecow application using both Docker and Kubernetes. The application is containerized, providing an efficient way to manage, scale, and deploy it across various environments with a strong emphasis on security.

## Project Overview

Wisecow App is a secure, scalable application that can be deployed using Docker containers and Kubernetes for orchestration. The application uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to ensure secure communication between clients and the server.

### Key Features:
- **Dockerized Application**: The application is packaged into a Docker image for easy portability across environments.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Kubernetes is used for automated deployment, scaling, and management of the application.
- **Secure Communication (TLS)**: The application uses SSL/TLS certificates to encrypt communication, ensuring that data transmitted between the client and the server remains private and secure.

## TLS (Transport Layer Security) in Wisecow App

To enhance security, the Wisecow application implements **TLS** for encrypting the data exchanged between the client and the server. The app uses SSL certificates to establish secure connections. The use of TLS ensures the following:
- **Confidentiality**: Data transmitted over the network is encrypted and cannot be read by unauthorized parties.
- **Integrity**: Data is protected from tampering or corruption during transmission.
- **Authentication**: The server's identity is verified, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.

### TLS Certificates:
- The application relies on two SSL certificates:
  - **Server Certificate (`wisecow-cert.pem`)**: This certificate authenticates the server's identity.
  - **Private Key (`wisecow-key.pem`)**: This key is used to establish the serverâ€™s identity and encrypt communication.

The certificates are typically stored in a secure directory within the project. These certificates must be properly configured in both the Docker and Kubernetes setups to ensure secure communication.

## Architecture

- **Docker**: The application is containerized using Docker, allowing it to run consistently across different environments. Docker ensures that the application is isolated and packaged with all dependencies, including the necessary SSL certificates for secure communication.
  
- **Kubernetes**: The application is deployed using Kubernetes, which provides orchestration for scaling, monitoring, and managing the application. Kubernetes helps automate the deployment process and ensures high availability and fault tolerance.

## Application Access

The application can be accessed securely through HTTPS, using the configured SSL certificates. By using TLS, the communication between the client and the server is encrypted, ensuring privacy and security.

## CI/CD Workflow

This project includes a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying the application. The CI/CD pipeline integrates Docker image building, pushing to a container registry, and deploying the application to a Kubernetes cluster.

The CI/CD pipeline ensures that the latest version of the application is always deployed securely and reliably, with all necessary security measures like TLS encryption in place.

## Requirements

- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration and deployment
- TLS certificates for secure communication
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation
